# Guibli Movies List per Producer Open Source

## The Project 

### Description 

Our site allows to recover all the films made by a certain producer thanks to a filtering system. When you search for a producer in the search bar, you will have a list of all the films he has made.

### Technologies 

Regarding the choice of our technologies we chose the Fetch API and Javascript which provides an easy and logical way to retrieve resources across the network in an asynchronous way.Our biggest challenge was the design of the filtering system. We tried several techniques to get there.

## Set up 

### Installation
